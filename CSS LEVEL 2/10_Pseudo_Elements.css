/* 
In CSS, pseudo-elements are used to style a specific part of an element's content or create visual effects 
without adding extra markup to the HTML. They are denoted by double colons (::) and allow you to 
target certain parts of an element, such as the first line, first letter, 
or insert content before or after the element's content.

Here are some common pseudo-elements and their usage with examples: */

/* 
1. ::before and ::after:
   These pseudo-elements allow you to insert content before or after the element's content. */

   /* CSS PART */
   .box::before {
     content: "Before";
   }

   .box::after {
     content: "After";
   }


   /* HTML  */

   <div class="box">Content</div>

   /* Result: */

   Before Content After

/* 
2. ::first-line:
   This pseudo-element targets the first line of the element's content.  */

   /* CSS */
   p::first-line {
     font-weight: bold;
   }

   /* HTML: */
   <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>

   /* Result: */ 
   (The first line will be displayed in bold.)

/* 
3. ::first-letter: 
   This pseudo-element targets the first letter of the element's content. */

   /* CSS */
   p::first-letter {
     font-size: 24px;
     color: red;
   }

   /* HTML: */
   <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>

   Result:
   (The first letter "L" will be larger and displayed in red.)

Pseudo-elements are powerful tools to add decorative elements, such as icons or styling to text,
without cluttering the HTML with unnecessary tags. Keep in mind that not all elements support 
all pseudo-elements, and some pseudo-elements might have limitations on where they can be used 
(e.g., ::first-line can only be used with block-level elements). 
Always refer to the official documentation for more details and browser compatibility information.
