A class selector is a term used in the context of web development and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). 
It refers to a way of targeting and applying styles to specific elements on a web page.

In CSS, you can assign a class to one or more HTML elements by using the "class" attribute. 
The class attribute acts as a hook or identifier for those elements, allowing you to style them 
collectively or individually. To create a class selector, you prepend a dot (.) followed by the name of the class.

For example, let's say you have several paragraphs on your web page and you want to style them differently. 
You can assign a class to each paragraph using the class attribute in the HTML code:
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```html
<p class="red">This is a red paragraph.</p>
<p class="blue">This is a blue paragraph.</p>
<p class="green">This is a green paragraph.</p>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
In the CSS code, you can then define styles for each class selector:
```css
.red {
  color: red;
}

.blue {
  color: blue;
}

.green {
  color: green;
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this example, the class selector ".red" will target the paragraph with the "red" class and apply the specified style (red text color). 
Similarly, ".blue" targets the paragraph with the "blue" class, and ".green" targets the paragraph with the "green" class.

By using class selectors, you can easily group and style elements based on their shared characteristics. It provides a flexible and reusable 
way to apply styles to specific elements throughout your web page or website.
