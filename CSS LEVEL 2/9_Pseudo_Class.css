Pseudo-classes are a concept used in cascading style sheets (CSS) to target and style elements based 
on specific conditions or states. Pseudo-classes allow you to apply styles to elements that are not 
part of the HTML structure but are related to their current state or position in the document.

Pseudo-classes are denoted by a colon (:) followed by the name of the pseudo-class. 
They are added to the selector of a CSS rule to specify the conditions under which the rule should be 
applied. Here are a few commonly used pseudo-classes:

1. :hover: This pseudo-class targets an element when the user hovers over it with the mouse cursor. 
           It is commonly used to change the appearance of links or buttons when they are being 
           interacted with.

2. :active: This pseudo-class targets an element while it is being activated or clicked by the user. 
            For example, it can be used to change the background color of a button when it is being 
            pressed.

3. :visited: This pseudo-class targets links that have been visited by the user. It allows you to 
             differentiate between visited and unvisited links and apply different styles to them.

4. :focus: This pseudo-class targets an element that currently has the input focus. It is often used 
           to style form fields or other interactive elements when they are selected by the user.

5. :nth-child(n): This pseudo-class targets elements that are the nth child of their parent. 
                  It allows you to select and style specific elements in a set, such as every other 
                  element or every third element.

These are just a few examples of pseudo-classes in CSS. There are many more available, 
each serving a specific purpose and allowing you to apply styles based on different conditions or 
states of elements. Pseudo-classes are powerful tools for creating dynamic and interactive web designs. */
