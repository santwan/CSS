The ID selector is a CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) selector that targets elements based on their unique identifier, known as an "ID." 
In English, an ID selector is a way to specify a particular element on a web page using a specific ID value assigned to that element.

To use an ID selector, you first assign a unique ID to an HTML element by adding the "id" attribute to the element's opening tag. 
The ID value must be unique within the entire HTML document. For example, you can assign the ID "myElement" to a specific `<div>` element like this:
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
<div id="myElement">...</div>
```
----------------------------------------------------------
Once you have assigned an ID to an element, you can target it in CSS using the ID selector. 
The ID selector starts with a hash symbol (#) followed by the ID value. For our previous example, the ID selector would be written as:
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```css
#myElement {
   /* CSS rules for the element with ID "myElement" go here */
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------
By applying styles within the curly braces after the ID selector, you can define how the element with that specific ID should appear on the web page. 
The styles can include properties like color, font size, background, and more.

The ID selector is powerful because it allows you to apply unique styles to individual elements on a web page. 
It is typically used when you want to target a specific element and provide it with a distinct appearance or behavior that differs from other elements on the page.
