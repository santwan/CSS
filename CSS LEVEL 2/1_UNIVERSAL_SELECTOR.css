The universal selector in CSS is represented by an asterisk (*) and 
is used to select all elements within a document. 
It matches any element type, including HTML tags, and applies styles to all elements in the document.
When you use the universal selector in CSS, it targets every element on the page, 
regardless of its type or location within the HTML structure. 
This selector is often used to apply global styles or to reset default styles.
Here's an example of using the universal selector to target all elements and apply a specific style: 


* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

The universal selector can also be used to select all elements within a specific element. For example, 
the following CSS code will set the font size of all <p> elements to 16px:
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
p * {
  font-size: 16px;
}
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
/* 
In this case, the asterisk selector will select all child elements of the <p> element, 
regardless of their type. This means that the font size will be set for all text nodes, images, and other elements within the <p> element.

The universal selector is a powerful tool that can be used to style all elements on an HTML page.
However, it is important to use it carefully, as it can also be used to overwrite more specific styles.

2. They can be less efficient than using more specific selectors.
3. They can be difficult to read and understand.
4. Overall, universal selectors can be a useful tool for styling HTML pages. 
   However, it is important to use them carefully and to understand their limitations. */
