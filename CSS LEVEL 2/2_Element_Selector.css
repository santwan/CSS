In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), the element selector is a fundamental feature that allows you to target and apply styles to specific HTML elements on a web page.
It is represented by the element name itself, such as `div`, `p`, `h1`, `a`, and so on.
When using the element selector, you specify the desired HTML element name directly in your CSS rule. For example, 
if you want to style all paragraphs (`<p>`) on your page, you would use the following CSS rule:
___________________________________________________________________________________________________
p {
  /* CSS styles here */
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This rule would apply the specified styles to all `<p>` elements found within the HTML document.

The element selector can be used alone or in combination with other selectors, such as class selectors or ID selectors, to further refine the targeting of specific elements. 
For instance, you can apply styles to only the paragraphs within a particular `<div>` by combining the element selector with a class selector:
___________________________________________________________________________________________________
div.my-container p {
  /* CSS styles here */
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this example, the styles would only affect `<p>` elements that are descendants of `<div>` elements with the class "my-container".

The element selector is versatile and can be used to target any valid HTML element. 
It provides a powerful way to apply styles consistently across multiple elements of the same type or to customize the appearance of specific elements on your web page.
