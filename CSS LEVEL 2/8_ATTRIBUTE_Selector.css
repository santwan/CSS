An attribute selector is a feature in web development and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that allows you to select HTML elements based on their attributes and attribute values. 
In simple terms, it's a way to target and style specific elements that have certain attributes assigned to them.

To use an attribute selector, you typically include it within square brackets `[ ]` in your CSS code. Inside the brackets, 
you specify the attribute you want to target, followed by an optional attribute value. Here's an example:
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

input[type="text"] {
  /* CSS rules */
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the example above, the attribute selector is targeting `<input>` elements with the attribute `type="text"`. 
This selector will match any `<input>` element where the `type` attribute is set to `"text"`, allowing you to apply specific styles to those elements.

Attribute selectors can be quite versatile and allow you to target elements based on various attributes, such as `class`, `id`, `href`, `src`, and many more. 
You can also combine attribute selectors with other selectors to create more specific targeting rules.

Here are a few examples of attribute selectors:
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
- Selecting elements with a specific class:

div[class="highlight"] {
  /* CSS rules */
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Selecting elements with a specific attribute (regardless of the value):

a[target] {
  /* CSS rules */
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Selecting elements with an attribute value starting with a certain string:

img[src^="https://example.com/images/"] {
  /* CSS rules */
}
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

By using attribute selectors, you have more control over styling specific elements based on their attributes, making your CSS code more precise and targeted.
