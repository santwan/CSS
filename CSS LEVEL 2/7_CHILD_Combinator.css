The Child combinator, denoted by the ">" symbol, is a selector in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) used to target elements that are direct children of a specific parent element. 
It establishes a relationship between the parent element and the selected child element.

When you use the Child combinator, it selects only the elements that are direct descendants or children of the parent element, 
excluding any elements that are further nested within other elements.

For example, let's say we have the following HTML structure:
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```html
<div class="parent">
  <p>This is a direct child paragraph.</p>
  <div>
    <p>This paragraph is not a direct child.</p>
  </div>
</div>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To apply a style to the direct child paragraph, you can use the Child combinator in CSS like this:
```css
.parent > p {
  /* CSS styles for direct child paragraphs */
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this case, only the paragraph element directly inside the `div` element with the class "parent" will be selected. 
The nested paragraph inside the inner `div` will not be affected by this CSS rule.

By using the Child combinator, you can precisely target specific elements within a hierarchical structure and apply styles or perform actions on them.
