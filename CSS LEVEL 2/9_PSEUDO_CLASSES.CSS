/* 
In CSS, pseudo-classes are used to select and style elements based on their state or relationship with 
other elements. Pseudo-classes begin with a colon (":") and are followed by a keyword that represents 
the specific state or condition.

Here's an explanation of some commonly used pseudo-classes in CSS:

1. :hover - This pseudo-class is used to select and style an element when it is being hovered over by
            the mouse cursor. For example: */

a:hover {
  color: red;
}

/* In the above example, when you hover over a link (`<a>` element), 
the color of the link will change to red. */

/* 2. :active - This pseudo-class is used to select and style an element while it is being clicked 
             or activated. For example */

button:active {
  background-color: blue;
}

/* In the above example, when you click on a button (`<button>` element), the background color of the 
button will change to blue. */

/* 3. :focus - This pseudo-class is used to select and style an element that has received focus, 
            typically through keyboard navigation. For example: */

input:focus {
  border-color: green;
}

/* In the above example, when an input field (`<input>` element) is focused, 
its border color will change to green. */

/* 4. :first-child - This pseudo-class is used to select and style the first child element of its parent. 
                  For example: */

li:first-child {
  font-weight: bold;
}
/* 
In the above example, the first `<li>` element within its parent `<ul>` or `<ol>` will be displayed 
in bold font weight. */

/* 5. :nth-child() - This pseudo-class is used to select and style elements based on their position 
                  within their parent. It takes a formula or keyword as an argument to determine 
                  the pattern of selection. For example: */

tr:nth-child(2n) {
  background-color: lightgray;
}

/* In the above example, every even-numbered `<tr>` element within a table will have a light gray 
background color.

These are just a few examples of commonly used pseudo-classes in CSS. Pseudo-classes provide a 
powerful way to target and style elements based on different states or relationships, 
allowing for more dynamic and interactive web designs. */
