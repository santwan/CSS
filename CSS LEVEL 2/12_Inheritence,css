<!-- Inheritance in CSS refers to the ability of certain CSS properties to be passed down from a parent 
element to its child elements within the HTML document. It allows child elements to automatically 
inherit the styles of their parent, simplifying the process of styling and maintaining consistency 
across a website or web application.

When a CSS property is set on a parent element, its value can be inherited by its children, unless 
specifically overridden by a different style rule. This inheritance process applies to properties 
related to typography, text, and some visual styles, such as font family, font size, color, 
line height, and text alignment.

For example, if you set the font size to 16 pixels (px) on a parent element, all its child elements 
will have a font size of 16px unless you explicitly specify a different font size for those children.

Here's a simple example:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    /* Parent styles */
    .parent {
      font-size: 16px;
      color: #333333;
    }

    /* Child styles (using inheritance) */
    .child {
      font-weight: bold; /* This will be inherited from the parent */
    }

    /* Child styles (explicitly overriding inheritance) */
    .override {
      font-size: 20px; /* Overrides the inherited font size */
      color: red; /* Overrides the inherited color */
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="parent">
    This is the parent element.
    <div class="child">This is the child element with inherited styles.</div>
    <div class="override">This is the child element with overridden styles.</div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
<!-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this example, the `.child` div will have a bold font-weight because it inherits it from the 
parent's styles. The `.override` div, on the other hand, explicitly sets a font size of 20 pixels 
and a red color, overriding the inherited styles.

Remember that not all CSS properties are inheritable. Some properties, like margins, padding, 
and display, do not inherit by default. To ensure proper inheritance, you can use the `inherit` keyword explicitly in your CSS rules. 
For instance, setting `margin: inherit;` will cause the child element to inherit the same margin value as its parent. -->
