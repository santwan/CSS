The adjacent sibling combinator is a selector in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that allows you to target an element that immediately follows another specific element.
It is denoted by the "+" symbol and is often referred to as the "adjacent combinator" or "adjacent selector."

In simpler terms, the adjacent sibling combinator allows you to select an element that comes right after another element of a specific type. 
It is used to apply styles or perform actions on the targeted element based on its relationship with the preceding element.

For example, let's say you have a list of paragraphs (`<p>`) and you want to style the second paragraph differently from the others. 
You can use the adjacent sibling combinator to select the second paragraph like this:
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```css
p + p {
  /* Styles for the second paragraph */
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this case, the selector "p + p" targets the `<p>` element that directly follows another `<p>` element. 
So, any styles defined within the curly braces will be applied only to the second paragraph.

It's important to note that the adjacent sibling combinator only selects the immediate sibling element. 
If there are multiple elements of the same type following the preceding element, only the first one will be targeted.

Overall, the adjacent sibling combinator is a useful tool in CSS that allows you to apply specific styles or actions to elements based on 
their position in relation to other elements.
